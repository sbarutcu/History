I set up the alter for sundays / Communion bread baker / Wedding custodian. I help the pastor with weddings doing all different kind of things neccessary to keep the bride happy and for the day to go smoothy. I clean up and pack up everything, used for the wedding at church and set up for communion and set up the alter for the next day.                                                                                                                                                                ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ,                                                                                    ,Christian - protestant,Grace Lutheran                                                                                           ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , ,no,no,yes but not within the last 12 months,no,no,no,no,yes but not within the last 12 months,no,yes but not within the last 12 months,no,                        ,no involvement,"yes, volunteered but not in the last 12 months","yes, I have volunteered in the last 12 months",no involvement,"yes, volunteered but not in the last 12 months",no involvement,no involvement,"yes, volunteered but not in the last 12 months",3,church                                                ,3,books                             ,                                                             ,Usually,Sometimes,Yes,Hillary Clinton,Democrat,Somewhat liberal,"Yes, but not in the last 12 months","Yes, but not in the last 12 months",I haven't been involved in any organizations lately                                                                                                                                                                                                            ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ,                                                                                                                                                                                    ,"I read at my grand daughters school when asked.
